# Flashy

This is a port of [mjlaufer/flashy.nvim](https://www.github.com/mjlaufer/flashy.nvim) for TextMate.

I use this for [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) (and `git diff`) syntax highlighting via [git-delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) and [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat).
